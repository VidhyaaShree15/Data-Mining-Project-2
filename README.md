# Data Mining Project 2

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data mining project. The project includes tasks such as using the Apriori algorithm, analyzing transaction datasets, identifying contextual and behavioral attributes, outlier detection methods, scraping and processing HTML tables, and time series forecasting.

## Skills Used
- Apriori Algorithm
- Transaction Dataset Analysis
- Contextual and Behavioral Attribute Identification
- Outlier Detection
- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Time Series Forecasting

## Contents
1. **Apriori Algorithm:**
   - Advantages of Apriori over computing support of all subsets.
   - Generating candidate itemsets and calculating supports.

2. **Transaction Data Analysis:**
   - Identifying frequent itemsets and calculating support.
   - Contextual and behavioral attributes for identity theft detection.

3. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Proximity-based methods for detecting outliers in datasets.
   - Identifying outliers using statistical methods.

4. **Web Scraping:**
   - Scraping HTML tables using BeautifulSoup.
   - Converting scraped data into pandas DataFrames and cleaning data.

5. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - Smoothing time series data using moving averages.
   - Forecasting with AR and ARMA models using smoothed data.

## Usage
To run the analyses and visualizations, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can execute the provided code snippets in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.
